# Project I.C.T

Project I.C.T is the effort to make cyber tools and script that can be used for red teaming and also blue teaming enviroments. The tools we develop are to be used at your own risk as we are not responsible for how you decided to use them. 

The project is self run and non-profit so development is and will be to our best ability. We also accept anyone that will like to contribute to our repos if we think that the contribution is better than what we currently have.
